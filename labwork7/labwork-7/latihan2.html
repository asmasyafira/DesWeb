    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p>
        The <span class="highlight">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, 
        <span class="highlight">Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an <span class="highlight">
        Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 
        majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <span class="highlight">
        superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span> 
    <br><br>
        The <span class="highlight">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in the 
        management of the <span class="highlight">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous 
        statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MPA department. PTIK is a study program that will 
        produce graduates who are <span class="highlight">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>. So, it would be better 
        if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span class="highlight">Building Engineering 
        Education</span>, and <span class="highlight">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information 
        technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="highlight">resource sharing with the mathematics 
        study program.</span>
